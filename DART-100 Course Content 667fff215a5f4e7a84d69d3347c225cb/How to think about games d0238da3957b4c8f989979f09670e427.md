Recalling the introduction to this class, and the overlapping domains of art, design, and pop culture, I’m curious how you feel about the selection of a video game as this week’s case study.

Are video games art? Are they design? 

What about other types of games? 

How do you approach the role of entertainment and fun in your work?

In is 2020 book, [Games: Agency as Art](https://academic.oup.com/book/32137), philosopher C. Thi Nguyen argues that the really special quality of video games is their ability to use the player’s agency as an experiential design element. The following excerpt comes from a conversation between Nguyen and journalist Ezra Klein on an [episode of Klein’s podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-c-thi-nguyen.html):

> Reiner Knizia, one of my favorite game designers— I was trying to figure out what games do and how they work and what makes them special— and I found this interview where he just casually says, **“The most important thing in my game designer toolbox is the point system because the point system tells the players what to care about.”**
> 

> And the more I thought about this, the more I thought it revealed what makes the experience of games so compelling, and so beautiful, and so dangerous, which is that they simplify the value landscape. I’m trying to live a good life and all the values that are out there for me are really complicated and really weird. Like, I am trying to parent, and be a researcher, and participate in the teaching community, and keep myself happy and not melt down during the pandemic. And it’s hard to know how to measure these values off against each other. And it’s hard to know how well I’m doing.
> 

> But games give you this one moment where instead of the nausea of a billion different values and you have no idea how well you’re doing— games give you a moment where you know exactly what you’re doing because there are points. And you know exactly how well you’ve done, right? You know exactly how you’re succeeding, because the points have clear explicit mechanical rules to tell you how to get them. And that’s not true of parenting, or research, or— I don’t know— being a spouse.
