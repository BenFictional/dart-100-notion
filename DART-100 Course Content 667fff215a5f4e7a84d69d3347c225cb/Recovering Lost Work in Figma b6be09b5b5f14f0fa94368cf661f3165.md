## Version Control

Figma autosaves your work.

It also includes a [version control system](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038006754-View-a-file-s-version-history) that lets you view or recover work from a previous point in time. 

The app creates a new autosave “checkpoint” after ~30 minutes of inactivity. But there is theoretically a chance that another student could accidentally mess up your design before an autosave checkpoint is created. 

My hope is that most exercises can be completed in one sitting. So, when finished, you will usually export your design as an image and submit it to Canvas as an additional safeguard. 

Here’s how to ensure your work is saved:

### How to manually create an autosave checkpoint

The easiest way is to select **“File » Add to version history**” or use the following shortcut:

- Mac: ⌘+⌥+S
- Windows: CTRL+ALT+S

You will be prompted to add a title to your autosave, which can help you find it in the Version Control timeline later. It will automatically show your username, so you can just write “Finished!” or whatever you like.

### What to do if something gets deleted

**If *you* accidentally deleted something:** Undo! (Mac: ⌘+Z | Win: CTRL+Z) 

**If *somebody else* messed things up:** 

1. Press ESC or click on an empty part of the Canvas to deselect. 
2. Find the filename in the center of the top menubar, and click the little 🔽  arrow next to the file name to select “Show version history.” 
3. Explore the version control panel in the right sidebar. You can see previous autosaves (Checkpoints) of the file, including times and users. 
4. Select a Checkpoint to view what the file looked like at that point in time; you may need to scroll around the Canvas to find the portion you’re interested in. You cannot select or edit anything yet.
5. Click the ellipsis button (”…”)  and then “**Duplicate**”
6. This creates a *new Figma file* that you can edit — separate from the shared class file. 
7. Click the 🔽 arrow next to the file name again, and choose “Move to Project” » then Choose “Drafts.” (This moves your new duplicated file ******out of****** the shared Team workspace.)
8. Select any desired content in the duplicated file and Copy/Paste it into the shared class file. 

**Other actions available for a given Checkpoint:**

- Copy link: Get a sharable link to a specific Checkpoint, if you need to show your instructor for some reason.
- Restore Version: **Please do NOT do this.** If you restore the File to “Monday” any work done by your classmates on “Tuesday” would still be saved in the version history, but (potentially a lot of) other students would have to laboriously recover their work via the steps above.

ℹ️ **TLDR Summary**

Never restore the class file to a previous Checkpoint. 

Instead, Duplicate a Checkpoint into your own private file, select your work, and copy/paste it back into the class file.
