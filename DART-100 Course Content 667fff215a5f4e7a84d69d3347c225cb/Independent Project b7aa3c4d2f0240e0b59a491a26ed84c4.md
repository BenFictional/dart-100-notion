After you have chosen a topic and begun your Research Board, you will also create an original work or art or design that relates to your topic in some way. 

You do NOT have to use Figma for this project! We’ve had a lot of fun over these past lessons, but you are welcome to use other software if you wish, or potentially use Figma in combination with other tools (e.g. importing drawings from Procreate into Figma or taking Figma assets into a video editor).

## Your project should:

- **Recreate formal qualities of your research subject.**
    - For example, if you researched 90s zine culture, you can emulate the typography, cut-paper layouts, and grungy Xerox effects of those zines. How does the work use color, shape, texture, line, typography, or other elements of design?
    - You do not have to stay *entirely* within your chosen style. For example, you could combine the visual language of 90s zines with that of super hero comics. Mash-up, remix, or update as you see fit.
- **Utilize digital media in some way.** You may combine digitally-produced work with analog materials or physical installations, or it can exist purely on the screen.
- **********Demonstrate mastery of the fundamentals of design.********** Review the vocabulary we have learned in this course (balance, texture, movement, color, etc.) and use them effectively in your own work.

The content of the work is up to you (the information, imagery, subject matter, etc.)

The medium and deliverables are also up to you. You might work in on or more of the following areas:

- Poster design
- Infographic or data visualization
- Illustration or photo-collage
- Book or Narratives (a comic, how-to-guide, editorial, or journalism)
- Animation or video
- UI design (website, app, or other mockup of an interface)
- Brand design (logos, design systems, icon sets, etc.)
- Interaction design (a real website or app)
- Experimental art or new media
- Other media welcome!

### Production

If you do want to use Figma, you can create a file in the Team workspace or in your personal drafts.
