Exercise Format: Multiple Unique Files
Figma File: Not started
ID: 13.1
Lesson: 13. Harmony
Text: Ready for Review
Type: ⚡️ Exercise
Video: N/A

## Objective

Research a specific style or genre of creative work, including formal analyses of specific pieces, and create your own artwork or design inspired by your subject. 

## Harmony

There is no Case Study in this lesson, as you will be choosing your own works of art or design to research!

But consider the Fundamental term of **Harmony** — which describes the unity of all elements in a work: the colors, shapes, composition, media assets, typography, and so on. Do they all express the same personality or stylistic references? To achieve a harmonious result, you will have to think carefully about the syntax of your visual elements. 

Recall the discussion of fashion from the beginning of the class: do all the components of the outfit add up to a purposeful sentence? 

## Choose a Topic

Choose a movement, style, or genre from the world of art or design. This could be a significant art historical movement or something very niche, like the [cover art of blank VHS tapes](https://flashbak.com/blank-vhs-cassette-packaging-design-trends-art-402545/). Your subject should have a recognizable style, with specific formal elements you can recreate and remix. 

Your topic should have recognizable stylistic details. Do not choose a medium (comics), but find a specific visual style, time period, cultural/geographic source, or a combination of these.

## Create an Image Board

Inspired by the image boards you’ve seen throughout this class, create a FigJam file to collect images, text, and links related to your subject. This will be a non-linear presentation, just like you’ve seen in class lectures. 

Your FigJam file should:

- **Include links for where you got all images:** Highlight text and paste to create pretty hyperlinks instead of pasting in long and unsightly URLs.
- **Demonstrate careful alignment and spacing:** The file itself should look well-designed! Use the range of tools available in FigmJam, including connectors, stickers, post-its, and so on.

### Tell the story your way

Previous lecture videos have included recorded narration to provide context and analysis of selected images. You can record a video — or — use more extensive text in the FigJam file that addresses the following details about your subject:

- **Historical and cultural context:** Where was this work made? By whom and whom? What sphere of creative work does it fall under?
- **Technology and process:** How was the work made and how did that influence its formal qualities? (i.e. the way it looks.)
- **Stylistic Motifs:** What formal elements or qualities define this style? How can you recognize it and why were those choices made by the creators?
- **Include at least three specific works:** Include the names of the artists or designers.
    - **At least one work must use digital technology;** for example, if you are focusing on Art Nouveau, you could include a few works from the turn of the century and a contemporary design that references that style.

### Requirements

- Videos should be 5-10 minutes in length.
- If not recording a video, aim for around 500 words of text.
- You could also use FigJam’s [Voice memo](https://www.figma.com/community/widget/1100947233945489758/Voice-Memo) widget to leave audio recording sprinkles around your image board.

### Video Resources

To record a video, you can use any screen-recording app, with or without your webcam visible. Penn State students have access to Zoom, which can be used as follows:

1. Login to [PSU Zoom](https://zoom.psu.edu/)
2. Begin a meeting in your [personal meeting room](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/203276937-Using-Personal-Meeting-ID-PMI) (nobody else needs to attend, unless you want to interview someone about your topic!)
3. Press [record](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360059781332-Getting-started-with-recording) 
4. The recording will be available in your Zoom dashboard, with a sharable link.

The university also provides access to [Kaltura Capture](https://knowledge.kaltura.com/help/kaltura-capture-overview), which can record screens and webcams.
