Developing your ideas in a shared workspace can be fun and enlightening, but it does require some care and empathy for your peers. Here are some notes on how to work in our Team workspace and what to do if something goes wrong. 

## Community Etiquette

- Make sure to label your work with your name — first name is sufficient, unless there’s someone else with your name in the class. (We’ll talk more about where exactly to put your name in each exercise.)
- Don’t edit someone else’s work! Unless you are both in file collaborating in some way.
- Say hello with cursor chat if you want, but if someone doesn’t respond or doesn’t want to chat, respect their wishes.

## Communication within files

### Cursor Chat

While working in a shared file, you may see other cursors moving around the Canvas — those are your classmates! You can use [Cursor Chat](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403130802199-Use-cursor-chat-in-Figma-design) to say hi. Just type a forward slash (`/`) followed by your message. 

If you find the cursors distracting, you can hide other user’s cursors with “View » Multiplayer Cursors”

### Audio Chat

You can press the 🎧 headphone icon in the top toolbar to enable audio chat. You’ll have to ensure your browser or desktop app has permission to access your microphone. 

This is only available to files within our Team workspace. Combined with the other collaboration tools described here, you may not need to Zoom with your instructor and can simply observe demos and chat in the file.

### Following and Spotlight

You can [follow](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040322673-Follow-collaborators-in-a-file) another user by clicking on their avatar in the top menu bar. This will take over your screen and you will see exactly what they see, as they navigate the Canvas. 

You can also request everyone currently active in the File to follow you, by using the [Spotlight](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/5025214483351) feature. 

### Comments

You can leave a comment anywhere in the Canvas by selecting the [Comment tool](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041068574-Add-comments-to-files) (C) and clicking somewhere. You can reply to comments and thread replies. 

While you’re working, you may wish to hide Comments without deleting them forever. To hide comments, press “Shift+C”.

You can Resolve a comment by selecting it and pressing the ☑️  checkmark button. Resolved comments can be viewed within the Comments sidebar if you select the “Sort/Filter” button.

Next we’ll go over Figma’s Version Control system and how to recover anything that another user accidentally edits.
