üëâ¬†Read page 54‚Äì71: ‚Äúmother cyborg‚Äù and ‚Äútypographic binary‚Äù

This book is a great resource for contemporary issues of graphic design, including interviews and practical advice from young designers. Ellen Lupton has written a [number](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/pensu/detail.action?docID=3387329&query=ellen+lupton) of [important books](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/pensu/detail.action?docID=3387581) on typography, which are also available through the university library as ebooks.  

The first chapter I‚Äôve selected for you, ‚Äúmother cyborg‚Äù includes a summary of important writing related to gender and technology, as well as examples of how science fiction can imagine new possibilities for culture and identity. 

A quote on page 61 is particularly relevant to our focus on the syntax and styles of visual design:

> When designers make choices about colors, fonts, textures, symbols, motifs, and images, they are performing styles‚Äîand sometimes inventing new ones or generating new meanings through shifts in context‚Ä¶ The performance of graphic design is never wholly original or fully liberated from rules.
> 

The second chapter ‚Äútypographic binaries‚Äù focuses on the design and categorization of text, and builds on the discussion of fluid boundaries to imagine new shapes for language ‚Äî which is highly relevant to this week‚Äôs Case Study. 

## Response

I'm these chapter, the authors describe many examples of binaries and hybrids (i.e. cyborgs). Choose one and connect it to your own lived experience. You might describe a social or professional binary, or look for examples of typographic, color-coded, or aesthetic conventions in the world around you. Be sure to include a brief quote from the reading to make it clear how your example is related.
