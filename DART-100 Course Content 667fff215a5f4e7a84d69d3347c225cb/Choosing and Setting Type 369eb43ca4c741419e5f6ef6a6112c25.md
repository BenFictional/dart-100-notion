## Response

Create a meme that explains or references a concept from the reading. You could caption an existing meme format to explain a typographic rule or phenomenon, or you could create your own meme with original photography or screenshots â€” perhaps you want to make fun of some bad typography you see this week? These should absolutely be funny.

Use a meme site like [ImgFlip](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator) or any tool you want.

Post your meme to the relevant Canvas discussion, and feel free to add any other thoughts in response to the reading.
