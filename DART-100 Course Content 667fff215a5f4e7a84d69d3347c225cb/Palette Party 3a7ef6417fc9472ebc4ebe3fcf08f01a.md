### 1. Setup

Find the shared file for this exercise in Figma. 

The first Page in the file is a template that you will use as the basis for your work. Within the lefthand Layers panel, reveal the list of Pages and right-click to duplicate the template page.

Rename the new page with your name.

### 2. Albers color study

In the case study of Gunta St√∂zel, I briefly mentioned Joseph Albers as a significant instructor at the Bauhaus and the author of [an influential book](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300179354/interaction-of-color/) on color theory. 

In the first section of the exercise file, adjust the colors of the gray and white squares to create the illusion that one color appears differently against unique background colors. 

This exercise, which [comes from Albers book](https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/08/16/interaction-of-color-josef-albers-50th-anniversary/), illustrates the concept of **color relativity**: that context and surroundings affect our perception of colors. (See more [examples](http://jlzych.com/2020/04/29/exercises-from-interactions-of-color-by-josef-albers/) or an [interactive web version](https://gray.joaopaulo272.repl.co/))

The color used for the small squares will be your ****************************main color,**************************** and you will continue using it in the rest of this exercise. 

The colors used for the large background squares should be **analogous to the main color.** One should be lighter in value than the main color, and one should be darker in value. 

Do not use pure white (#FFFFFF) or black (#000000) anywhere in this exercise. 

### 3. Alien Landscape

In the next section of the exercise file, create a simple landscape using shapes and drawing tools in Figma. Use only vector shapes and do not incorporate raster images. 

Take inspiration from the alien worlds of Metroid and make an evocative scene that uses shape, scale, and other fundamentals to convey the unique qualities of this world. 

******************Your landscape must include a foreground, middle-ground, and background.****************** Include shapes (rocks, plants, animals, buildings, etc.) close to the ‚Äúcamera‚Äù, in the middle distance, and then far away (perhaps beyond the horizon). 

Observe the use of layers and spatial depth in the following images. This is an important technique in photography and film too, as seen in the still from *Black Panther: Wakanda Forever* (2022), where cinematographer [Autumn Durald](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/11/wakanda-forever-cinematographer-autumn-durald-arkapaw-interview-1234785047/) uses opposing diagonal lines to draw our eyes toward the shot‚Äôs focal point ‚Äî but instead of showing the mural directly from the front, the three-quarters view creates depth and angles, accentuated by the receding layers of architecture.

**Use *****only***** the three colors from the Albers study in this design.** You can suggest shadows, lighting, or other details if you wish, or you can use the colors exclusively for the three layers of distance. 

Apply your three colors to the squares next to the Frame; these are **color swatches** that provide a quick overview of the colors in a design. 

As seen in the video, you can turn on Pixel Preview to achieve a kind of pixelated retro look; to exaggerate that effect even more, you can use the Scale tool (K) to shrink the size of your Landscape Frame. 

### 4. Color Variations

Once finished, duplicate Section 3 (hold Opt/Alt and click-drag to duplicate the Frame) and drag the new instances into the next Section of the page.

Create an additional four instances of the landscape, and modify the colors to achieve the following goals:

1. **Increase contrast** by adjusting only the *value* of your colors (a.k.a. lightness). 
2. **Decrease contrast** by adjusting only the *value* of your colors (a.k.a. lightness). 
3. **Increase the saturation** of all three colors. 
4. **Decrease the saturation** of all three colors. 

Update the colors swatches for each instance of the design.

### 5. Complex Palette

Duplicate one of the Frames (landscape + swatches) one more time and drag it into the final Section of the page.

For this iteration, you will create a **complementary color scheme** that includes tints and shades. **You** **must use the main (mid-tone) color from Step 2** and choose eight new colors that include a range of highlights, mid-tones, and shadows. 

Use saturation and value to emphasize the depth of your landscape. Create a clear separation of foreground, middle-ground, and background. 

You may draw additional shapes if you wish, to delineate highlights and shadows. For example, observe how ‚Äúshading‚Äù is achieved on the spaceship below ‚Äî each color would be a unique vector shape.

## Submission

1. In the Figma file, select ‚ÄúFile ¬ª Save to Version History‚Äù to ensure your work is saved. You will be prompted to enter a description, so just write ‚ÄúFinished!‚Äù or whatever message you like. This action is automatically associated with your username so you don‚Äôt need to write your name. 
2. Export your Frames as separate images

### Optional: Make it pixelated

If you want your exported images to appear pixelated, you can follow one of the methods shown in the video:

- Export Frame as PNG ¬ª Import PNG back into Figma ¬ª Scale it up to a larger size ¬ª Export.
- Zoom in and take a screenshot ¬ª Import screenshot back into Figma ¬ª Export.

### Requirements

You should ultimately have the following exported images:

1. Albers color study
2. Analogous Landscape
3. High contrast landscape
4. Low contrast landscape
5. High saturation landscape
6. Low saturation landscape
7. Complex landscape
