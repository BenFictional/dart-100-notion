## Revise Past Exercises

Look back at your work so far, including comments from classmates and your instructor. The mid-semester assessment will evaluate your work so far, and this week is an opportunity to revise and improve any of your past work.

You can make updates directly in the relevant Figma files, then export the final designs for submission.

For the assignment "**Cumulative Assessment 1**, you should submit exported images (PNG or PDF) of the following exercises:

- Shape Shifter
- Texturizer
- Palette Party
- Surface Tension
- Scene Change (submit via any of the following ways)
    - Include a video created by recording your screen.
    - Post a comment to the Canvas assignment with a link to the Figma prototype.
    - Include the link in your Self-Reflection Letter.

## Self-Reflection Letter

Use the following template to evaluate and contextualize your work so far. This is an opportunity to share challenges or struggles you faced, observe reoccurring trends, and set goals for the remainder of the semester. 

### Sharing and accountability

After you submit your Self-Reflection Letter, you will be assigned another student‚Äôs letter to read and reply to; that person will receive *your* letter as part of the peer review process. You will each be asked to leave a comment replying to each other‚Äôs concerns, goals, and reflections.

Near the end of this class, you and your partner will assess each other's progress. So think of these letters as a kind of contract ‚Äî your goals will be assessed later by your partner, instructor and yourself.

My hope is that this exchange can create a sense of camaraderie among students, and that you will have a deeper understanding of your partner's work when you see it throughout the second half of the class. I encourage you to share messages, questions, artists, or links at any time with your partner!

### Peer Feedback

When providing feedback on your partner‚Äôs letter, share your honest reaction and any of your own anxieties, goals, or experiences that feel relevant. 

You can view your partner‚Äôs work in previous Figma exercise files for further context. 

**Target length:** 150 words

## Submissions

- Submit your self-assessment letter to Canvas as a PDF file.
- Find your assigned partner on Canvas under the ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù page and then find your ‚ÄúPartners‚Äù group.
- After letters are submitted, you will receive an [assigned peer-review](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-know-if-I-have-a-peer-review-assignment-to-complete/ta-p/318) within that same Canvas assignment. Leave your feedback as a comment in Canvas.

1. ****************************************Artist or Designer:**************************************** 
    - Do you consider yourself more of an artist or designer? If you answer ‚Äúboth‚Äù which one takes precedence? Consider a hypothetical audience, venue, or purpose for your work.
2. **********Taste**********
    - What aesthetic tastes or predilections do you see in your work so far? Include some specific adjectives and/or stylistic genres (e.g. ‚Äúgrungy‚Äù or ‚Äú70s psychedelia‚Äù).
    - Include a quote from the Vanderbilt reading and connect it to your work in this class.
3. ********************Soundtrack********************
    - What is the soundtrack to your work? (Music genre, artist, or song.) This isn‚Äôt necessarily music you listen to while you work, but music that aligns with your aesthetics and creative vibe. If you can't choose something representative of your work overall, you can choose a soundtrack for a specific Exercise. This is a way to think about tone and genre, as well as an interdisciplinary thought experiment.
4. ************************************************Favorite Artist/Designer************************************************
    - Who is your favorite artist/designer that has been featured in class so far? This doesn‚Äôt have to be one of the primary Case Studies, but could be anyone mentioned in a reading or video. You can choose a specific work or simply name the person more generally.
    - Explain why you made this selection.
5. ******Alternative Case Study******
    1. For one of the Fundamentals we‚Äôve covered so far, share another artist or designer whose work displays mastery of the concept.
    2. Choose one: Balance, Texture, Movement, Color, Pattern, or Reflection
6. ************************************Favorite Exercise************************************
    - Which exercise was your favorite and why? (This could be your favorite *result* or your favorite *process*.)
7. ************************************************Strengths and Weaknesses************************************************
    - Identify one of your strengths and one weakness in the context of these exercises. This could be something related to form (messiness, color use..) or process (deciding when you‚Äôre done, submitting work on time‚Ä¶)
