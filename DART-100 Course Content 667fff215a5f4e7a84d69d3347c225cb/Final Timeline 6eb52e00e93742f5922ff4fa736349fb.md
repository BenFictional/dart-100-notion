This final lesson includes two main deliverables, which you should now be familiar with:

1. Research Board
2. Independent Project

We’re going to spend a little more time on these in comparison to our previous schedule of weekly exercises. Here’s the plan:

## Schedule for upcoming weeks

See Canvas for exact due dates. Assignment submissions are in **bold**. 

### Drafts

👉 **Submit a draft of the Research Board** — It doesn’t have to include complete text or voiceovers, but should indicate the breadth of your research and be legible to other people. Dump in a bunch of images, links, quotes, and materials about your subject and start to organize it. 

👉 **Submit a draft of your Independent Project** — It doesn’t have to be complete, and could take the form of multiple iterations, experiments, or mockups. But someone should be able to get the overall idea of what you’re trying to accomplish. 

### Peer Feedback

Explore the draft submissions from the entire class, to see what subjects and projects people are working on. But you will mostly focus on your **assigned partner** from the mid-semester self-reflection. 

Review their submissions for the final project and their self-reflection letter that you read previously. Is the work here fulfilling the goals they set for themselves? What else could they do to accomplish them? You may choose to review their work in other Figma exercises as well. 

👉 **Write a message to your partner with feedback** on their current drafts, research, and their progress on meeting their goals. You can message them through Canvas, email, or other communication app — but you must also submit it to Canvas so your instructor sees it. 

### Final deliverables

👉 **Submit revised versions of the following to Canvas:**

1. Research Board with final text or voiceover (Figma link).
2. Independent Project (Figma link or exported media files depending on the nature of your project; contact your instructor if unsure).

👉 ****************Submit revised versions of exercises from Unit 2.**************** Export these as images where applicable or include Figma links for animations. Submit to “Cumulative Assessment 2”
