## Objective

Create a minimalist illustration based on a scene from a book, film, or other story; consider the use of color, shape, line, and *movement* in your composition.

## Inspiration

- Cut paper collages from Molly Bang and [Saul Bass](https://www.artofthetitle.com/title/anatomy-of-a-murder/)
- Animated motion graphics by [Sue Doeksen](https://www.suedoeksen.nl/)

## Exercise Instructions

### 1. Choose a subject

Inspired by the Red Riding Hood illustration in the reading, choose a pivotal scene from a different story to illustrate. (A film, TV series, comic, video game, book, folktale, etc.)

### 2. Claim a Page

In the Figma file for this exercise, create a new Page by clicking the ‚ûï¬† plus button at the top of the left sidebar. 

Double-click the Page name and type your full name to claim it. 

You can view other pages to see what folks are working on, but only edit content on your page.

Select the Frame tool (F) and create a new Frame. From the preset sizes on the right, choose either option under ‚ÄúPresentation‚Äù ‚Äî Slide 16:9 (1920px x 1080px) or Slide 4:3 (1024px x 768px). These are common aspect ratios for screens and videos.

### 3. Draw some shapes

Start by drawing some custom shapes with the [Pen](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450213-Vector-networks) tool (P). These are also known as Vector Networks.

Consider the formal qualities and psychological effects explored in the reading. Your illustration can be quite abstract if you want (e.g. representing characters with triangles) or it can be more realistic. But focus on the overall composition more than the details. 

Remember you can set the background color of the Frame itself. 

Consider the emotional quality of your color palette, and try to restrict yourself to a limited set of colors you can use purposefully. 

### 3. Duplicate the Frame

Hold the Option/Alt key and click-and-drag on your Frame to create a copy to the right. 

### 4. Edit the second frame

Change the size or position of one or more element in the second Frame. 

If desired, you can create additional Frames, which will serve as steps (aka keyframes) in the animation. 

What should you animate? Think about your scene. It could be something subtle like a flickering candle flame, or something big and dramatic like a character flying in from off screen.

### 5. Apply Smart Animate

Select the Prototype tab in the righthand panel.

With your first Frame selected, drag a connection from the right edge to the second Frame. 

Change the animation trigger from ‚ÄúOn click‚Äù to ‚ÄúAfter Delay. The default delay of 800ms is fine, but you can edit that if you want; the goal is to simply have the animation play without requiring any user interaction. (The Prototype features are typically used to simulate interface designs, such as a mobile app.)

<aside>
üí° You can also trigger animations via interactions by tapping or hovering over an element in your design. This is fine to do for your project, if you want to do that instead of auto-playing.

</aside>

Change the animation method from ‚ÄúInstant‚Äù to ‚ÄúSmart Animate,‚Äù which will automatically interpolate your Frames and generate transitional frames between Frame 1 and Frame 2 (aka tweening). 

Make your animation loop by dragging a Prototype connection from your last Frame back to the initial one and setting the animation method as described above. 

### 6. Test your animation

Click the big ‚ñ∂Ô∏è¬† Play button in the top-right menubar. This will open a new tab within Figma, showing a Prototype view of the current file. 

### Achieving a handmade look

To achieve something like the beautifully imperfect cut-paper aesthetic of artists featured in this lesson, you can try any of the following!

- [Rough](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/908327335402084440): A Figma plugin to give your shapes some rough edges, by adding additional anchor points for a subtly jagged look.
- Texture Image Fills: Like we‚Äôve done in a previous exercise, you can layer images on top of color fills. Try searching online for ‚Äúfree paint textures‚Äù and so on.
    - [Lost and Taken](https://lostandtaken.com/) (great free texture images)
    - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/texture) (popular stock photos, including some textures)

## Submission

1. In the Figma file, select ‚ÄúFile ¬ª Save to Version History‚Äù to ensure your work is saved. You will be prompted to enter a description, so just write ‚ÄúFinished!‚Äù or whatever message you like. This action is automatically associated with your username so you don‚Äôt need to write your name. 
2. While viewing your Prototype, click the Share button to copy the link for your prototype and submit that to Canvas. 

### Can we export these as videos?

Sadly, no. But you can use the [Export to GIF/Video](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1170836206919391034) plugin or record your screen.

On Mac, you can press ‚åò+Shift+5 to open Quicktime‚Äôs screen-recording tool, and set the boundary of the area to be recorded. Once you‚Äôre looking at the recorded video, press ‚åò+T to trim it.

(You don‚Äôt have to do this, but you might want to for posterity). 

### Requirements

- An animated prototype that uses two or more Frames to create an animation.
- A simplified depiction of a scene from a movie/show/comic/video game that demonstrates compositional strategies from the Molly Bang reading.
