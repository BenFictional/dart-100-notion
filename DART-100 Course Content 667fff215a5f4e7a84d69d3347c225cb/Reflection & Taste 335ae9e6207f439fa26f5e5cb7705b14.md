The first of ten cards in the original [Rorshach Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test).

To mark the halfway point of this course, this week will be devoted to revising previous exercises, reflecting on everything we've covered so far, and setting some goals for upcoming lessons.

In visual design, reflection is precise symmetry. When a shape is reflected along one or more axes it can reference natural forms or distort imagery beyond recognition. 

But reflection is also fundamental to art and design in another sense. Reflecting can be a pause; a moment of self-aware editing. In life drawing classes, students are often taught to step away from their papers to assess the accuracy of their marks compared to their subject. When absorbed in the work of creating ‚Äî a [flow state](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01348/full#:~:text=Csikszentmihalyi%20(1999)%20described%20the%20elements,and%20awareness%20merged%2C%20balance%20between) ‚Äî it is easy to lose track of broad relationships or appearances. From a step removed, artists can assess their work like an impartial editor, then leap back to the paper to make corrections. One of my drawing professors compared it to fencing ‚Äî an attack and a retreat ‚Äî and as you practice this mental maneuver you will do it countless times while you work, at an increasingly subconscious level.

But today is an intentional pause. In addition to revising past exercises, I also want you to consider the idea of **taste**. As you develop your visual sensibilities and compositional skills, you are also cultivating your creative tastes ‚Äî what you do or do not like. 

A lot of writing about taste approaches it from the perspective of consumers, advising individuals to try out new styles of clothing, furniture, or music to discover what suits them. If someone has ‚Äúgood taste‚Äù you might expect them to have comprehensive knowledge and elite preferences in one of those areas. But taste is also important for creators ‚Äî the people making those cultural and artistic works ‚Äî like you.

I actually think there is overlap between ‚Äútaste-as-consumer‚Äù and ‚Äútaste-as-creator‚Äù, and that as you become more sensitive to aesthetic preferences and craft, you will become a better artist ***and*** a more sophisticated consumer. In their 1925 book *Art in Everyday Life*, Harriet and Vetta Goldstein (sisters, and college professors of home economics) use visual art and aesthetic principles as a handbook for developing aesthetic taste in fashion, interior decorating, and everyday life. 

‚ÄúTaste is molded, to a very large extent, by the things which surround us,‚Äù they write, explaining that it is a ‚Äúvery great privilege for children to live in a home in which there is a high standard of beauty. We like to think of standards for beauty as broad and adaptable, and to regard them as goals that are never fixed. They shift and change, and each of use hopes that [their] own standards will keep moving forward.‚Äù

At the end of this week, you will submit a package of revised exercises and a Self-Reflection document that will be explained on the next page.

In preparation for that document, and to gain new insights into how taste works, **read the following excerpt** from *[You May Also Like: Taste in an Age of Endless Choice](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/216518/you-may-also-like-by-tom-vanderbilt/)* by Tom Vanderbilt (2016). Vanderbilt is a sociologist, and cites a variety of novel studies to support his musings on taste. This is from the introduction to the book, and begins with a classic question: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your favorite color?‚Äù
