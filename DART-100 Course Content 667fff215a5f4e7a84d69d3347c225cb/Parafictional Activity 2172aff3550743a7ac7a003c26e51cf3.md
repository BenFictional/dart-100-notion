Lesson: 9. Hierarchy
Text: Ready for Review
Type: ⚡️ Exercise
Video: N/A

## Objective

Create a design based on an authoritative reference image that subverts or reimagines the content while showing mastery of layout and hierarchy.

## Exercise Instructions

### 1. Choose a reference image

Find an example of graphic design or publication that feels official and authoritative in some way. It must include text, and may or may not have images. It should feel well-designed or at least believable and real.

Find a specific image! Don’t just imagine a generic example or recall something from memory.

Potential references:

- A newspaper or magazine page
- A book, comic, or magazine cover
- Album art
- TV news screenshot with chyron text
- Forms, certificates, or official documents
- Currency
- App or website pages
- Software interfaces
- ???

### 2. Brainstorm

Imagine ways to remix, subvert, parody, or otherwise reimagine the content of your image. What could be changed? (The subject, genre, historical era, economic class, etc.)

Or reverse the sequence and begin with an idea or cause that you passionately want to articulate, and think of a reference image that could be a vehicle for that. For example, you want to make something inspiring action in response to the climate crisis, so you decide to remix… the signage at a gas station… or the confirmation page of an airline website.

Come up with a few ideas and pick your favorite!

### 3. Recreate the design

In the Figma file for this exercise, create a new page and edit the page title to show your name.

Import your reference image and scrutinize the fonts, colors, decorations, and layout. For some brands, you may be able to find their official fonts by searching online (e.g. “iOS system font” or “Instagram brand assets”). For websites you can right-click and inspect text to identify fonts. You may not be able to reproduce fonts exactly, but try to use something visually similar, being mindful of font classifications.

You can use the Eyedropper in Figma to copy colors directly from your reference image.

You can set the reference image as a background fill in your main design, placing your content directly on top of the reference content, or create your design to the side of the reference image. (The scale or dimensions may change if your new content is longer/shorter than the actual content.)

## Requirements

- An original design that thoughtfully remixes a reference image
- Must include text, and demonstrate a professional use of hierarchy and typographic standards (font choice, line length, and line height)

## Submission

Export a PNG or PDF of your original design. 

## Submission

1. In the Figma file, select “File » Save to Version History” to ensure your work is saved. You will be prompted to enter a description, so just write “Finished!” or whatever message you like. This action is automatically associated with your username so you don’t need to write your name. 
2. Export your design as a PNG or PDF to submit to Canvas. 
    - You could potentially create a video, website, Figma prototype, or other format for this, so if it’s not explicitly an “image” use your judgement on what to submit.
