**Benjamin Andrew: ****First, can you introduce yourself and tell me a little about your relationship to art and design? 

**Anna Divinsky**: I am an artist, art professor, and Digital Multimedia Design program Coordinator. I teach at the School of Visual Arts and work for the Office of Digital Learning. I have been teaching art online at Penn State since 2005.

I am originally from Kyiv, Ukraine. My family and I immigrated to the US when I was 12. My love for art and design started very early in life. My mother, Larisa Divinsky, was an artist and toy designer. She designed many toys and interactive puppet books which were sold throughout Ukraine. She often worked from home, and I watched her creative process, which seemed magical. Her use of geometric shapes to create repetitive patterns became ingrained in my own art-making process.

I love simple geometric shapes, especially circles. They can be found throughout my home. Circles bring me happiness, they inspire me, challenge me, and keep me engaged. Everywhere I go, I‚Äôm drawn to circular designs.

Circles and spheres in my interior design

My work is primarily fiber. I paint on silk and create site-specific fiber sculptures and installations. When painting on silk, I get lost in the application of repetitive shapes and how they take on a life of their own, becoming something new and unexpected. When creating, I constantly yearn for repetition. I sense this comes from watching my mom glue hundreds of tiny shapes to her illustrations. There is something so intrinsic about the process of repetition. It‚Äôs meditative, soothing, and never-ending. It creates a sense of peace and control within me, but also a hunger for more, filling the space, and never quite feeling like it‚Äôs enough. I enjoy exploring relationships between open space and very intense, detailed clusters of designs.

**BA:** Thank you for sharing those images of your mother‚Äôs books. Those are an interesting parallel to your work, and I think students would do well to reflect on their own foundational art experiences and influences like that.

Based on your affinity for circles and the idea of patterns "filling the space," I can see why you chose Yayoi Kusama to discuss here! But before we get to that, I'd like to dwell on those craft catalogs for a moment ‚Äî would you ever be interested in making something mass-produced like that? Or conversely, what is the draw of singular art objects in your studio practice?

**AD:** I love the idea of one-of-a-kind art, something that is unique and can‚Äôt be replicated. With that said, I would love to make mass produced work. It‚Äôs important for art to be available to all. I‚Äôve always dreamt of making an abstract picture book or designing wallpaper.

**BA:** Okay, so let‚Äôs move on to the Kusama pieces, and specifically her installations at the [Mattress Factory](https://mattress.org/) in Pittsburgh. Can you tell me about your experience with that work?

**AD**: The first time I walked into Yayoi Kusama‚Äôs installations at the Mattress Factory, I was overwhelmed and enamored by their repetitive patterns. The walls and floor were covered with dots and surrounded by mirror walls which created a sense of infinite dots. They were everywhere, and after a while, it felt like they were moving, and I was moving with them. I knew about Kusama‚Äôs work before visiting the Mattress Factory, but experiencing it in person was incredible.

When I was a college student, I remember learning in one of my art history classes about *horror vacui*, or fear of empty space, in Non-Western Art. That concept was fascinating to me. An image completely filled with pattern without any open space left was so saturated, lush, and overwhelming.

[[Ceramic tile ceiling decoration in the Nasr ol Molk, Shiraz, 19th century, Iran](https://www.the-art-minute.com/just-a-second-horror-vacui/)](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/i5p7yL1BB0N9__Cg27lyD7dq9fomYHHwq-S0YDgS66MXqgzy7msP31kSgFjnrr5JnNZ2AB-Tzt5RfPnOENGopMEr1zOXXw-qU7ce8zLk87lfg2goetwNEHoIpmmxHZJOAHt9dbJFIS2YIcpw3Hzt7jM)

I see a similar approach in Kusama‚Äôs work. She does have open space around the dots, which makes her design a bit more calm in comparison to the ceiling decoration above. Her design is playful and whimsical. It transports one into a fantastic realm. I love that Kusama plays with scale by changing the dots‚Äô size and sometimes color. This adds movement and dimension, challenging the viewers‚Äô perception.

**BA:** There‚Äôs a fun tension when you *completely* fill a space with pattern, because at some point the pattern disappears ‚Äî if everything is mark-making then it becomes a solid surface. Kusama describes that effect in a more psychological way in [her writing](https://mattress.org/works/infinity-dots-mirrored-room/):

‚ÄúA mirror is a device which obliterates everything including myself and others in the light of another world or a gallant apparatus which creates nothingness.‚Äù 

If you read more about Kusama, her interest with infinity and nothingness comes at least partly from traumatic mental health episodes ‚Äî which you might not expect when you first see these brightly-colored installations. I imagine a lot of people might view them as trippy backgrounds for a selfie, which I‚Äôve seen some museums really encourage with [exhibitions of installation art like](https://www.wired.com/story/selfie-factories-instagram-museum/) the [Rain Room](https://www.lacma.org/art/exhibition/rain-room). Even work by serious artists like [James Turrell](http://web.guggenheim.org/exhibitions/turrell/) can feel like a spectacle for crowds. But maybe that‚Äôs the point. Immersive installations like Kusama‚Äôs or Turrell‚Äôs try to capture a sense of [the sublime](https://www.theartstory.org/definition/the-sublime-in-art/). Do you think there‚Äôs a difference between *Serious Art Experiences* and more casual encounters? How do you open yourself up to the more introspective experiences in a Kusama room as a viewer?

**AD**: It helps me to understand the artist‚Äôs intentions, background, and process. Going into these experiential spaces, it‚Äôs important to know more about the artist and their goals. I often hear students share how their perspectives changed after learning more about an artist. If we go into an exhibit being familiar with the artist‚Äôs life, work, and intentions, then our experience will be different. On the other hand, not knowing anything about the artist can provide spontaneity in how we view the work (similar to a child who encounters new things for the first time). I love having a keen understanding of Kusama‚Äôs message. This makes her work so much more powerful than just a fun and interactive environment. Her approach to processing and sharing her mental illness is brave, therapeutic, and groundbreaking. When I interact with Kusama‚Äôs work, I feel like I become part of her vision, but at the same time, it allows me to pull in my own feelings and thoughts. What an incredible inspiration spanning over many decades!

Here is [a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRZR3nsiIeA) for students to learn more about Kusama‚Äôs life, work, and process.

**BA:** Okay, let‚Äôs think about pattern in another context ‚Äî the decorative arts!¬† We often encounter a division between traditionally high art forms (serious, rarified, traditionally masculine) and decorative arts (common, lacking content, and traditionally feminine). Earlier in this class, I showed students how this manifested at the Bauhaus, where women were not allowed to specialize in architecture and were funneled into weaving classes.

This binary is certainly outdated and problematic, but there are still distinctions between fine art and decorative art, whether they are mass-produced *designs* or handmade treasures. So how do you see pattern fitting into that conversation?

There are a lot of contemporary artists, including the [Pattern & Decoration](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-pattern-decoration-movement-challenged-machismo-modernism) movement from the 1970s, that have blurred the boundaries of high and low, decorative and conceptual.¬† Two of the members of that group, Valerie Jaudon and Joyce Kozloff wrote that the ‚Äúapplied arts‚Äù are associated with words like ‚Äúsensuality,‚Äù ‚Äúpleasure,‚Äù and ‚Äúornament.‚Äù

I think it‚Äôs worthwhile for students to consider their reaction to those words! I had some foundational experiences with conceptual art and the bare efficiency of Modernism, so I‚Äôve often rejected those things in my personal taste, but I recognize where that impulse comes from and that people will have different views here.

**AD:** To me, decorative art has always been as legitimate and serious as any other, including Modernism. While I certainly see the distinction between fine and decorative arts, I am glad that the line continues to blur. Coming from a space where I was constantly surrounded by the handmade, non-Western Art was fine art to me, even though it wasn‚Äôt viewed that way. I love the combination of the decorative and conceptual, and hope that it keeps evolving. It‚Äôs crucial that we reflect on the past, learn from it, and find innovative ways to create new and inclusive art that challenges some of the past boundaries and limitations. I see a space for pattern to do just that.
