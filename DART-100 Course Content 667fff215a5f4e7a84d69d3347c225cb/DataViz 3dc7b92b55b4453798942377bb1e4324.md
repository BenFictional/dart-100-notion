Besides the examples in this Lesson‚Äôs video interview, you can find many, many examples of data visualizations online. One from the video that I‚Äôd like to especially highlight for this exercise is the following music visualizations from the New York Times (follow the link to see the animated versions).

## Objective

Create a compelling data visualization that reveals insights about a durational activity or event.

## Exercise Instructions

### 1. Collect

Consider a subject from your daily life or available resources that occurs over a span of time. Collect data in a spreadsheet (Google Sheets, Excel, or Notion) for ease of sorting and transformation later.

Here are some possible ideas:

********************************From Daily Life:********************************

- Record the number of events in a day and their time or duration.
- Count things around your home or workplace.
- Measure objects or timespans.
- Create an inventory of items, with associated data for each one (measurements, categories, frequency, etc.)

**************************************From Existing Media**************************************

- Analyze a song. The New York Times example above illustrates song structure, but you could measure the volume (amplitude) at regular intervals, count instruments, word usage in lyrics, or whatever you can think of. You might use an audio editor like Adobe Audition or the free browser app [AudioMass](https://audiomass.co).
- [Analyze the structure of a book of film](https://lithub.com/alix-ohlin-on-how-to-map-the-shape-of-your-short-story/), in terms of scenes, narrative, character development, etc.
- Analyze the formal qualities of a book or film; taking screenshots at intervals, removing [everything except punctuation](https://just-the-punctuation.glitch.me/) from a text, the frequencies of events or words.

### 2. Assess

Once you have a bunch of data in a spreadsheet, consider what datapoints you might compare or illustrate visually. This could involve performing transformations or calculations in your spreadsheet, such as calculating averages, percentages, and so on. This article [explains the basics of Google Sheets](https://blog.coupler.io/calculations-in-google-sheets/) and how to use formulas. 

What numbers stand out? What is the story told by the data? 

If there isn‚Äôt an interesting story, consider what other data or insights you could add into the mix to create an insightful comparison or provide context. The amount of coffee I drink in a day isn‚Äôt that interesting in isolation, but if you present that data alongside my wakeup times and scheduled meetings... we have a story. 

üëâ¬†**Browse visualization types at these sites:**

- [Data Viz Project](https://datavizproject.com/)
- [Visual Frameworks](https://visualframeworks.com/)

Choose a visualization type that can emphasize the story you want to tell about your data. Are you showing a bunch of shapes in sequence? Connections between items? Comparing the scale (size) of relative numbers? How could you arrange these shapes in a novel way that feels appropriate for the subject?

Make some sketches on paper to imagine how these visualization types could be used for your project. You can combine or adapt these standard visualization types, make them illustrative or decorative in accordance with your subject, or whatever you want. 

### 3. Create

Create your own page in the relevant exercise file, and then make a data visualization based on your data.

Do not use conventional charts like a bar chart, line graph etc. These charts could provide a starting point, but try to go further ‚Äî for example, instead of rectangles in a bar chart, use a different shape that signifies a second piece of data or helps to show what the data is saying.

All the elements of design can be used to signify information: shape, line, color, scale, pattern, proximity, and so on. Consider how to show the *********character********* of information in addition to quantitative data.

Avoid making an infographic, which uses visual illustration as decoration alongside conventional charts. Try to create an original design whose composition and scale is *determined by your data.* 

Use the numerical display of an element‚Äôs size (which you can edit in the righthand Design panel) to precisely scale shapes to show proportional relationships. For example you might visualize 4 and 1 apples with a rectangle that‚Äôs 200px tall and another one that‚Äôs 50px tall.
