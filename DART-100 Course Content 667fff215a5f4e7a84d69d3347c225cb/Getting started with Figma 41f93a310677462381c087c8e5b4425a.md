For much of this class, we will be using the popular design app Figma to create, tinker, and hang out.

## What is Figma?

Figma is a web app, which means you can use it in your web browser, though you can also install a desktop app to run it separately. (I mostly use the desktop app.)

While often used to create user interfaces for apps and websites, Figma is a great 2D design tool that will help us explore the fundamental concepts of picture-making and visual syntax. Figma relies on vector shapes, and has a lot in common with Adobe Illustrator ‚Äî so if you‚Äôve used that, you should feel right at home.

**Vectors** are shapes defined by points, that can be scaled up or down infinitely without losing image quality. They are distinct from raster images like JPEGs, which are grids of pixels. Purely vector graphics *have no pixels*, although you can add a JPEG photograph into a Figma file. 

Within Figma, you can create a Design File or a FigJam file. We will primarily be working with Design Files, but [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/) is worth knowing about too. It‚Äôs a simpler version of Figma, geared for quick brainstorming and diagramming, with virtual post-it notes and easy whiteboard drawing tools. 

Any Figma file can be easily shared online with a private or public share link, just like Google Docs. 

You can also collaborate on a Figma file ****************at the same time**************** as other users, synchronously working on a design together. We‚Äôll talk more about this in a minute. 

## Step 1. Creating a Student Account

To get the most out of Figma, you should signup with your university email address and [get verified as a student](https://www.figma.com/education/). This gives your account some special features, and ensures you can access required exercise files. 

üö®¬†*You must use your Penn State email address when creating your account. If you have a personal Figma account, you should create a new one.*

## Desktop or Web App?

You can use Figma in your web browser or as a standalone desktop app. They have the same functionality.

**Web app**

- Easy access to other tabs in your browser.
- Automatically includes all fonts from Google Fonts.
- Install the [Figma Font Service utility](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039956894-Access-local-fonts-on-your-computer) to access all fonts on your computer.

**Desktop app** 

- Looks cleaner because it‚Äôs not in your browser.
- Includes tabbed navigation for multiple Figma files, separate from your web browser.
- Automatically loads all fonts on your computer (plus Google Fonts).

## Step 2. Accessing the Team workspace

By default when you create a new Figma file, it will only be visible to you. These files are located in your **Drafts** (which is a sort of ambiguous name, but you can think of it as your private files).

From the Figma file browser, you can also find **Community** files and peruse a vast library of templates and user-created content, which you can duplicate and remix in your private Drafts.

You can't create ‚Äúfolders‚Äù to organize files, instead files can be placed within **Teams** or **Projects**. 

![figma-home-edit.png](Getting%20started%20with%20Figma%2041f93a310677462381c087c8e5b4425a/figma-home-edit.png)

You will access our weekly exercise files within a shared Team. Once you‚Äôve created your Figma Education account, you can join the **DART-100 Team** via the link on Canvas. (Only verified Education accounts can be members of the Team.)

If you have any trouble accessing the Team, just contact your instructor. 

![figma-team-edit.png](Getting%20started%20with%20Figma%2041f93a310677462381c087c8e5b4425a/figma-team-edit.png)

Teams you are a member of will be visible in the left sidebar of the file browser. Within the DART-100 Team, you will see files for all of our exercises. You can sort these alphabetically or by the most-recently edited; you can also search for files by name from anywhere in Figma.

The **Recents** tab will display recently-edited files from your Draft, Teams, or files other people have shared with you.

Everyone who‚Äôs a member of the DART-100 Team can edit the exercise files. That means that for a given exercise, *******************************************everyone will be working in the same file.******************************************* 

On the next page we‚Äôll discuss how to make this shared workspace fun, respectful, and safeguards to protect your work.
