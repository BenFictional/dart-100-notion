## Exercise Instructions

### 1. Locate a site

Choose a location in your home, work, or outside where you can mount some printed paper. Ideally you will use more than one sheet of paper to cover an object, surface, or specific portion of something in a bold, repeating pattern. 

You could do a test run with blank paper, even layering materials to make it look like the paper is the *interior* of something.

You will eventually have to photograph your installation, so consider the framing of your eventual shot and where the camera might be. Look at the space through your camera to anticipate and plan for this later step, aiming to make the photograph compelling and well-composed.

### 2. Brainstorm associations

Write a list of imagery, concepts, memories, sensations, or associations with your intended site. You can use these words to inform the next step of the design process. 

Consider the cultural and social relationships of the site: who is there? who is not? what activities or goods pass through this area?

### 3. Create visual components

In the Figma file for this exercise, create a new Page and enter your name as the page title. 

Create a new Frame using the Letter-size paper template. 

Start drawing shapes or illustrations related to the word bank generated in the previous step. Look at actual patterns related to any relevant cultures, media, or time periods that may be of interest. You may wish to recreate specific shapes or remix existing patterns. Your pattern can include abstract shapes, figurative illustrations, or a combination. 

Consider the combination of pattern and site. Will the pattern represent some aspect of the site or act as a shocking juxtaposition? (e.g. a pixelated glitch texture placed on the side of a tree.)  Your pattern should reflect the site‚Äôs history, memories, visual forms, or cultural/social relationships. Don't make arbitrary shapes.

Start by generating a bunch of visual components; don‚Äôt worry about the specific arrangement yet. 

### 4.  Prepare Pattern Tile

Create a new Frame that is smaller than the Letter-size frame ‚Äî we‚Äôll call this the Tile-Frame. This will become the basis of your repeating pattern, so consider the scale relative to the Letter-size frame. Figma doesn‚Äôt provide measurements in inches, so you can‚Äôt get super precise here.

Arrange some shapes within the Tile-frame. This tile will be repeated in a grid, so be mindful of any shapes that don‚Äôt fit entirely within the frame. 

Select both the Tile-frame and the Letter-size frame (hold Shift to select multiple elements).

Search for the [Pattern Fill](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1067417425616378100) plugin and click Run ‚Äî you will be able to confirm which Frame is used to create the pattern tile and which is the destination. The Letter-size frame should be filled with your pattern! (The plugin creates an image based on your pattern and sets that as the Fill for the target frame.)

There are some additional pattern-making plugins you can try out by searching for ‚Äúpattern,‚Äù but I like this one. 

Experiment with the design and size of your tile (you can always press undo to go back). Try changing the size or aspect ratio of the Tile-frame! Experiment with the colors of your background and shapes! You can also change the scale and rotation of the pattern in the Fill settings of the target frame.

In most cases, you should try and minimize the visibility of the ‚Äúgrid‚Äù in your pattern, moving shapes to disguise the repetition and make things feel evenly distributed.

### 5. Print

Export your Letter-size frame as a PDF and print a bunch of copies. Print some extras in case the installation takes a couple attempts. 

If you don‚Äôt have a printer at home, take a flash drive to your local print shop, such as FedEx or the UPS store. 

To achieve a seamless pattern, you may also want to trim the borders of your paper ‚Äî if you‚Äôre at a print shop, see if they have a paper cutter to do this easily. 

### 6. Install and Document

Mount your printed papers at your installation site. The pattern probably won‚Äôt line up perfectly, so you‚Äôll have to overlap the sheets. Use glue, tape, or whatever is necessary. 

Document your creation in a well-composed photograph or video. 

## Submission

1. In the Figma file, select ‚ÄúFile ¬ª Save to Version History‚Äù to ensure your work is saved. You will be prompted to enter a description, so just write ‚ÄúFinished!‚Äù or whatever message you like. This action is automatically associated with your username so you don‚Äôt need to write your name. 
2. Post your final documentation in the first Page of the relevant Figma file, making sure to rename the Frame with your first and last name.

### Requirements

- Design a repeating pattern in Figma
- Print it on paper and cover an object or space with your pattern.
- Photograph it with care and submit the final image to Canvas.
