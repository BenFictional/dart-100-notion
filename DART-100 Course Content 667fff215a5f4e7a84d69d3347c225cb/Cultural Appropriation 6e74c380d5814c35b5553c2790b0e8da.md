In this week‚Äôs Case Study, John Whitney‚Äôs experimental short film *Arabesque* (1975) showed just how early artists were using computers to make art. It also raised some thorny questions about cultural appropriation and aesthetics. 

While this class is focused on the *syntax* of visual design, it is impossible to separate that entirely from *semantics* (the meaning) of shapes, colors, and compositions. 

Artists and designers need to draw inspiration from outside of themselves, but visual motifs and forms are not pure visual markers divorced from social history. It might be tempting to wish for a ‚Äúboundaryless world,‚Äù as Ligaya Mishan puts it in the following reading, ‚Äúwhere we might walk at will, eat and dress, make art, write music and spin stories following whatever whim takes hold, free of the burden of identity.‚Äù But that‚Äôs not how it‚Äôs worked out for many artists, including some guilty of more cringe-worthy appropriation than Whitney‚Äôs film.

## Reading Discussion

For this discussion I‚Äôve pasted the entire contents of the reading into a FigJam file within our shared Team workspace. (The file is called ‚ÄúCultural Appropriation Discussion‚Äù.)

You can read the article there, or find *[What Does Cultural Appropriation Really Mean?](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/t-magazine/cultural-appropriation.html)* by Ligaya Mishan on the New York Times website. A PDF is also available below.

Within the FigJam file, **leave three replies with Sticky Notes (S) or Comments (C)**. Stickies will automatically display your name on the bottom. Comments can receive threaded replies.

You can also:

- Use the Highlighter tool (Shift+M) to highlight passages of the text.
- Use Stamps (E) or Stickers to show your reactions.
- Paste in relevant images or links (pasting a URL automatically generates a thumbnail preview of the page)

Anything other than highlighting should be placed to the side of the text, so as not to obscure the article. 

Share your honest reactions to the article, connections to the Case Study lecture, relevant personal experiences or artwork, and anything else that shows your critical engagement with this topic.
