This weekâ€™s Case Study is Super Metroid (1994) for Super Nintendo (SNES) by Nintendo, directed by Yoshio Sakamoto, which illustrates the fundamental concept of **Color**.

This is a long video! But thatâ€™s because it includes a bunch of important material on **color theory,** including**:**

- Optical color-mixing
- Digital color spaces
- Using the color wheel
- Practical uses of hue, saturation, value, and dynamic range

Letâ€™s get into it (and nobody will judge if you watch at 1.5 speed).
