Read more about [type anatomy](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/introducing_type/an_overview_of_latin_type_anatomy) at Google Fonts; you don‚Äôt have to memorize these terms, but they can help you with this exercise as you assess your type specimens. 

Their article about font [classification](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/introducing_type/making_sense_of_typographic_classifications) may also be helpful to identify fonts with contrasting shapes.

## Inspiration

These are some cool type foundries where you can find really unique fonts. Most of these cost money, and you should stick to Google Fonts for this Exercise, but browsing these links might give you ideas for really expressive, unexpected ways to draw letters.

## Exercise Instructions

### 1. Choose your specimens

Select two fonts from different classifications, that are dramatically different in their expressive voice and shape (E.g. a thin and elegant serif and a swanky handwriting font). Browse [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for ideas and place some sample text in Figma to compared fonts side-by-side.

üö®¬†*Please only use fonts from Google Fonts for this assignment, as custom fonts may cause issues for other users accessing the shared file.*

For the most interesting results, choose two fonts that are very different from each other.

If desired, you could choose a non-English or special character for ONE of your letters, such as:

- A character from a language that doesn't use Latin characters, as seen in the Case Study.
- A punctuation mark‚Äî the interrobang is an example of hybridizing two punctuation marks.
- A glyph or special character
- A graphic image or illustration (such as an emoji); this will be more work.

In the Figma file for this exercise, claim an empty frame and rename it with your name.

What letter(s) should you choose? Think about which letters highlight the distinctive shapes of your font. For each font (and your new hybrid letters) choose one uppercase and one lowercase letter. You can do more letters if desired for a short word.

### 2. Overlap and adjust

Duplicate your type specimens and place them on top of one another. It's handy to change the color of one to tell them apart.

As seen in the video, there are various ways to approach the hybridization:

- Edit the vector network of one letter
- Combine two letters with Booleans, or slice them into discreet pieces.
- Draw an entirely new vector network.

### 3. Finalize

Tidy up your Frame when complete:

- Add a background color or gradient.
- Add small labels for each font, including inventing a name for your hybrid font.
- Align everything and space it out nicely.
