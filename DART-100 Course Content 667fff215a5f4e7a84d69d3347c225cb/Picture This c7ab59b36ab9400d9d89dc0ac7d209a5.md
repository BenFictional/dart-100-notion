The following excerpt comes from Molly Bang’s 1991 book *Picture This*, which uses cut-paper illustrations to examine compositional strategies of picture-making. Bang is primarily known for writing and illustrating children’s books, and this reading does involve the story of Little Red Riding hood, but it is a fantastic explanation for anyone looking to master the fundamental principles of visual design.

## Response

**Find a still from a film or television series** that demonstrates one of the compositional strategies described in the reading. Animated work is okay to use! 

**Post the image** in the relevant Canvas discussion with a brief description of how it uses shapes or color effectively.

**Include the name of the Cinematographer (**a.k.a. Director of Photography) for your pick. A series might include multiple people in that role, but find someone to attribute your image to — it’s important to contextualize working creators and not treat images as anonymous content. 

## An ode to paper

In a later section of the book, the author describes the benefits of working with cut paper, which you can keep in mind in the context of this week’s Case Study and exercise, even if we’re using vector shapes instead of paper ones:

“Why is cut paper such an effective tool for making pictures and for exploring picture structure?

“First, construction paper is cheap, and it is familiar. It is easy to work with and eminently ‘nonthreatening.’ For many of us, cutting construction paper puts us back into nursery school or kindergarten again — into a time when we got absorbed in the task at hand, with little thought of anything beyond the Right-Now-of-Making-This. It was a time of great absorption, or ‘flow,’ a time when we all knew we were artists, or rather, when we didn't worry about it one way or the other because we were absorbed not in who or what we were, but in what we were doing.

“Second, working with cut paper encourages experimentation. Every piece of paper can be recut, repositioned, or replaced with a different piece or pieces. We can play with a single element while the rest of the picture stays exactly the same, and we can see how various changes in that one figure affect the whole. Cut paper is a perfect experimental tool, enabling us to play with picture struc­ture in a way no other medium does. No paper shape we put on the page is final in the way a stroke of paint or marker or even pencil is. A picture of cut pieces of paper becomes final only when we paste the pieces down — which is why nothing should be glued until we're really satisfied. Playing with paper is making a series of beautiful, controlled experiments.

“Last of all, cut paper makes us concentrate on structure, emotional clarity, gesture, and overall cohesion rather than on line, detail, ‘realism,’ or shading. Cut paper keeps us to the basics.”
