Alright, buckle up… This video is kind of long, but it covers a lot of important stuff and sets the table for everything that will follow! I’ve done my best to synthesize my decades of work in digital art and design into some *********real talk********* that I hope will provide useful context for your own endeavors. 

Each week in this class will focus on a different **********************fundamental ********of visual design******************.****************** In the video, I’ll share some lists of popular terms and principles of visual composition. But this week’s fundamental isn’t actually on those lists! 

****************Context**************** is the idea that everything is perceived relative to its surroundings. When you hear a musical note, it isn’t high or low until you hear a second one. Visual and other aesthetic experiences also vary depending on their contexts: the location and scale of the work, the time of day, the lived experiences of the creator and the viewer. Creative work is a dialogue between two or more people, and another important bit of context is what **professional domain** those people believe the work to fall into. How do we categorize and shape expectations for art or design? A lot of it depends on the professional context — or world — that you are trying to inhabit. 

Here’s what’s covered in the video:

- The distinctions between art, design, and their various subdomains.
- The fundamentals of visual design.
- The structure, premise, and development of this course.
- A brief history of art and design: the conventional version and what is often left out.

📝 **Have something to write with on hand**, as there are some points in the video where I’ll ask you to write or draw things.
